# Vision Model Performance Assessment

## Summary Table of Image Classifications

| **Image** | **True Label** | **Compliance Level** | **Score** | 
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Cybersecurity Awareness Poster | Good | B (85/100) |
| 2 | Phishing Scam Warning | Poor | C (75/100) |
| 3 | Cybersecurity Slogan Graphic | Good | B (82/100) |
| 4 | Incoherent Cybersecurity Draft | Poor | D (62/100) |
| 5 | Comprehensive Cybersecurity Advocacy Poster | Excellent | A (92/100) |

## Assessment Criteria

### Accuracy
Models must discern thematic coherence (e.g., Image 5 vs. Image 4) and technical execution.

### Efficiency
Prioritize detecting narrative intent (Image 5's implied story) over keyword density (Image 1).

### Qualitative Gap
Models may struggle with:
- Disjointed drafts (Image 2/4) vs. intentional minimalism (Image 3)
- Cultural context (e.g., "Fantasty cash" in Image 2)

## Recommendation
Focus model training on narrative intent and compositional hierarchy to distinguish *Excellent* (Image 5) from *Poor* (Image 4) submissions.
